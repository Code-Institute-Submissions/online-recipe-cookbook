# Data Centric Development Milestone Project #
This project is an online database for recipes, called Clever Cooking. Upon arrival to the site, the user will see a list of top recipes, ordered by the amount of ‘likes’ they have. From this home page the user can also search for existing recipes based on dietary requirements.
Users can quickly see from a glance the image of the recipe, the name of it, and the number of likes it has.
You can click on the recipe to get a quick view of it, and then also click ‘View full recipe’, which brings you to the actual page with the recipe on it.
Once the user clicks on the full recipe, they have the ability to see different aspects such as the Cooking time, the Calories, tools used and the method of cooking.
Comments are available here also, and the user may post their own comment, which will appear underneath.
## UX ##
The objective of the site is to find, view and edit recipes online. This site makes it easy for the user to upload their own recipes and view more. 
The homepage contains all that a user would need from the perspective of uploading and viewing recipes.
### User stories: ###
1. As a baker, I want to upload my new cake recipe.
2. As a potential baker, I want to view a cake recipe.
3. As a site visitor I want to show appreciation of other peoples recipes.
4. As a coeliac, I want to view all gluten-free recipes.
5. As a vegetarian, I want to share my meat-less dishes.

### Existing Features ###

- User accounts, where users can post recipe’s under their own name
- Users may become rated based on their recipe ratings
