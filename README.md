# Data Centric Development Milestone Project #
This project is an online database for recipes, called Clever Cooking. Upon arrival to the site, the user will see a list of top recipes, ordered by the amount of ‘likes’ they have. From this home page the user can also search for any existing recipe.
Users can quickly see from a glance the image of the recipe, the name of it, and the number of likes it has.
You can click on the recipe to get a quick view of it, and then also click ‘View full recipe’, which brings you to the actual page with the recipe on it.
Once the user clicks on the full recipe, they have the ability to see different aspects such as the Cooking time, the Calories, tools used and the method of cooking.
Comments are available here also, and the user may post their own comment, which will appear underneath.
## UX ##
The objective of the site is to find, view and edit recipes online. This site makes it easy for the user to upload their own recipes and view more. 
The homepage contains all that a user would need from the perspective of uploading and viewing recipes.
### User stories: ###
1. As a baker, I want to upload my new cake recipe.
   - User goes to the home page
   - User clicks the ‘+’ button 
   -User fills in recipe details and clicks submit
2. As a potential baker, I want to view a cake recipe.
   - User goes to homepage
   - User searches ‘cake’ on the top of the page
   - User clicks on whichever recipe they like
   - User may leave a comment on the recipe

- Users may become rated based on their recipe ratings
## Technologies Used ##
 
## Testing ##
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
